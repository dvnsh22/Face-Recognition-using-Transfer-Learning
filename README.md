<li> This Face Recognition system is developed by the concept of Transfer Learning. It uses Keras library of Python for image preprocessing and building the Neural Network. The CNN architecture used in the project is VGG-16. The model weights from ImageNet have also been used that will be transferred and used for the purpose of face recognition. </li>
<li> This project is capable of distinguishing between multiple classes of inputs provided. Image Augmentation has also been used in order to increase the dataset. The accuracy offered by the model is 69.66%. </li>
<li> The workflow and details have been described in my blog:
